# Windoge98 ICRC-1 Implementation
This repo contains the source code for the Windoge98 ICRC1 token, 
a fork of the [NatLabs implementation](https://github.com/NatLabs/icrc1) of the 
[ICRC-1](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1) token standard. 

NB: A logo field has been added to the construction arguments. Below is the example from NatLabs, modified to include the logo field.
    
  - Replace the values enclosed in `< >` with your desired values and run in the terminal 

  ```motoko
    cd windoge98-token
    mops install
    dfx start --background --clean

    dfx deploy icrc1 --argument '( record {
